# merit-chat

This is a prototype chat application based on [ipfs-pubsub-room](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-pubsub-room). If I can get the p2p chat working, then I'll use it as a sandbox for developing e2e encryption and 'merit' calculations based on SLP tokens for the [PSF](https://psfoundation.cash).
